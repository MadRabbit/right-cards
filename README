Welcome
=======

Right cards is a playing cards engine implemented with the RightJS framework.

There's no any games logic, just a pure card deck, styles, etc.

Usage
=========

You should copy to your application the following files and directories

 * build/right-cards.js
 * src/styles.css
 * images/

If you change the images directory name or its relative path to the styles.css
file, then you need to adjust the names in the stylesheet file.

There are just two classes now

DC.Deck
  shuffle()
  each(callback, scope)
  pull()

DC.Card(rank, suit, size)
  open()
  hide()
  flip()
  opened()
  hidden()
  setSize(size)
  element
  onClick(callback)
  
When you create a new deck it will automatically create a standard 52 cards
deck without jockers. Jockers and other deck types are coming soon.



Images License
==============

The images in the project are mere integrated from the GNU project svg
images and published under the terms of the the GNU GPL license v3.
